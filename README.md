# GOAT-Decoding-a-Successful-App
GOAT: Decoding a Successful App is a computer science competition where students all across the world program a new app feature using App Lab (JavaScript) to help GOATâ€™s customers discover more fashions and trends. I participated in this competition and programmed an app with three different sections of a pattern quiz, a shoe showcase screen, and a price evaluator.
