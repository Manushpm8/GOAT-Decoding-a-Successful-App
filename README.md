# GOAT-Decoding-a-Successful-App
GOAT: Decoding a Successful App is a computer science competition where students all across the world program a new app feature using App Lab (JavaScript) to help GOATâ€™s customers discover more fashions and trends. I participated in this competition and programmed an app with three different sections of a pattern quiz, a shoe showcase screen, and a price evaluator. I was selected as one of the top 20 competitors for coding a stellar app. As mentioned to me by the GOAT representatives, "through multiple rounds of judging by Amazon employees, GOAT employees, and the GOAT CEOs themselves, and the judges selected your prototype as a standout".
